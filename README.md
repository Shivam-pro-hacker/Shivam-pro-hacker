## ⚠️ Trust Is The First Vulnerability.

## 🕶️ About Me

I don’t chase vulnerabilities.  
I study why they exist.

I look past tools into system architecture —  
trust boundaries, hidden assumptions, failure paths.

Anything built can be understood.  
Anything understood can be broken — or made resilient.

I focus on structural weaknesses:  
auth logic, trust chains, state flow.

I learn how systems collapse.  
So I can build what doesn’t.

## 🕶️ Identity

I operate where systems fail and security begins.  
I study how things break — then design how they should never break again.  

My work lives at the intersection of:

- Cybersecurity Engineering
- Ethical Hacking
- AI-Driven Defense
- Secure Software Architecture

Silence is my signature.  
Execution is my proof.

## ☠️ Philosophy

Secure systems are not built by developers.  
They are built by those who know how to break them.  

I learn attacks.  
I engineer defense.  
I build what survives both.

---

## ☠️ Ethos

I am not interested in breaking things for spectacle.  
Only in understanding them completely.

Because complete understanding  
is the only real form of control.
