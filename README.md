## Hi there 👋

## 🕶️ About Me

I don't chase vulnerabilities.  
I study why they exist.

I move beyond tools and techniques into the architecture of systems —  
where trust boundaries are drawn,  
where assumptions fail,  
and where security is either engineered… or imagined.

My work is grounded in a simple principle:

> Anything built by humans can be understood.  
> Anything understood can be tested.  
> Anything tested can be broken — or made unbreakable.

I operate across the full security spectrum:

- Offensive analysis to expose hidden failure paths  
- Defensive engineering to eliminate them at root  
- Intelligent automation to detect what humans miss  

I am not interested in noise exploits or surface-level attacks.  
I focus on structural weaknesses — authentication logic, trust chains, state flow, and system behavior under stress.

Cybersecurity, for me, is not a domain.  
It is a lens for understanding technology itself.

I learn how systems collapse.  
So I can build systems that don’t.

Silence is my signature.  
Precision is my method.  
Security is my discipline.

## 🕶️ Identity

I operate where systems fail and security begins.  
I study how things break — then design how they should never break again.  

My work lives at the intersection of:

- Cybersecurity Engineering
- Ethical Hacking
- AI-Driven Defense
- Secure Software Architecture

Silence is my signature.  
Execution is my proof.

## ☠️ Philosophy

Secure systems are not built by developers.  
They are built by those who know how to break them.  

I learn attacks.  
I engineer defense.  
I build what survives both.
